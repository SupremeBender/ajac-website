# Flight.py Cleanup Changes

## Summary of Changes

The flight.py file has been thoroughly cleaned up to improve maintainability, reduce code duplication, and provide better organization and documentation. Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. **Consolidated Imports**
   - Moved all imports to the top of the file
   - Removed redundant imports in individual functions
   - Added missing imports (list_missions)
   - Organized imports into logical groups

2. **Extracted Common Data Conversion**
   - Created a single `convert_old_flight_data()` utility function
   - Used this function in both `get_flight()` and `get_mission_flights_data()`
   - Eliminated duplicate conversion code

3. **Improved Documentation**
   - Added detailed docstrings to all functions
   - Included type information and return values
   - Clarified function purposes and behavior

4. **Simplified Data Handling**
   - Consolidated pilot data migration into the main conversion function
   - Removed redundant `migrate_pilot_data_format()` function
   - Standardized error handling and logging

5. **Code Reorganization**
   - Placed helper functions before they are used
   - Improved code readability with consistent spacing and formatting
   - Enhanced error handling with specific error messages

6. **Enhanced Flight Class**
   - Kept the core Flight class unchanged for compatibility
   - Improved documentation around class methods

## Specific Improvements

- **create_flight()**: Improved formatting, error handling, and docstrings
- **get_flight()**: Removed embedded conversion function and used the common utility
- **get_mission_flights_data()**: Simplified conversion logic by using the common utility
- **join_flight()**: Added better error handling and improved parameter documentation
- **leave_flight()**: Enhanced documentation and clarified return values
- **delete_flight()**: Simplified and improved error handling

## Benefits

- **Reduced Code Size**: Eliminated approximately 100 lines of redundant code
- **Improved Maintainability**: Consistent style and better organization
- **Better Error Handling**: More specific error messages and consistent logging
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Clear docstrings for all functions and parameters
- **Simplified Logic**: Reduced complexity and consolidated duplicate logic
