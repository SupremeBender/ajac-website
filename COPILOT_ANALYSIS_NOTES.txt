=== AJAC DCS MISSION PLANNER - COPILOT ANALYSIS NOTES ===
Generated: 2025-05-29
Analyst: GitHub Copilot (Quality Control Analysis)

=== PROJECT OVERVIEW ===
- Flask web application for DCS (Digital Combat Simulator) mission planning
- Fictional command: AJAC (Arctic Joint Air Command) at Andøya Airbase
- Live production system used by real players
- Authentication: Discord OAuth2
- Storage: JSON files (no traditional database)
- Deployment: Apache + mod_wsgi + systemd on VPS

=== CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED ===

1. **DATA MIGRATION PROBLEM** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
   Location: models/flight.py lines 200-250
   Issue: Old flight format uses "members": ["username1", "username2"] (list of strings)
         New format uses "pilots": [{"user_id": "123", "username": "user1", ...}] (list of dicts)
   Impact: Data corruption, conversion errors, potential crashes
   Status: Has conversion logic but incomplete/fragile

2. **MISSING IMPORTS** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
   Location: models/flight.py lines 1-10
   Issue: Missing critical imports: json, os, logging, uuid, traceback
   Impact: Runtime errors, ImportError exceptions
   Evidence: Line 4 references 'logger' but logging not imported

3. **INCOMPLETE FUNCTIONS** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
   Location: models/flight.py save_flight(), get_flight(), get_mission_flights_data()
   Issue: Functions have incomplete implementations with missing returns
   Impact: Broken functionality, potential crashes

4. **SECURITY VULNERABILITIES** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
   - No input sanitization in forms/JSON processing
   - Direct file operations without path validation
   - Session data trusted without verification
   - No CSRF protection visible
   - Discord bot API calls without proper error handling

=== CODE QUALITY ISSUES ===

1. **Error Handling**
   - Inconsistent exception handling patterns
   - Some functions fail silently (return None vs raise Exception)
   - Network requests to Discord bot lack proper timeouts/retries

2. **Logging**
   - Mixed use of logger vs print statements
   - Inconsistent log levels
   - Debug logs may leak sensitive information

3. **Data Validation**
   - No input validation on forms
   - JSON data trusted without schema validation
   - User roles/permissions cached in session without refresh mechanism

4. **Performance Issues**
   - JSON files loaded/saved for every operation (no caching)
   - Nested loops in flight assignment (O(n²) complexity)
   - Synchronous HTTP calls blocking request threads

=== ARCHITECTURE ISSUES ===

1. **File Structure Mismatch**
   Instructions specify app/ directory structure but actual uses flat structure
   Current: features/, models/, utils/ at root
   Expected: app/features/, app/models/, app/utils/

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Missing config.py file (referenced but not found)
   - Secret config mixed with app config
   - No environment-specific configurations

3. **Dependency Management**
   - Flask-Discord version 0.1.69 (very old, potential security issues)
   - Mixed dependency versions
   - No version pinning strategy

=== SPECIFIC FINDINGS ===

**app.py Analysis:**
- Good: App factory pattern, logging setup, blueprint registration
- Issues: Complex role checking logic in root route, mixed authentication flows
- Security: Missing CSRF protection, session handling could be improved

**utils/storage.py:**
- Good: Consistent file operations, path handling
- Issues: No file locking for concurrent access, no backup strategy
- Performance: Loads entire JSON files for small operations

**models/flight.py:**
- Good: Clear class structure, data conversion awareness
- Issues: Missing imports, incomplete functions, complex assignment logic
- Critical: Data migration logic fragile and incomplete

**features/signup/routes.py:**
- Good: Proper authentication decorators, comprehensive logging
- Issues: Complex role checking, hardcoded bot API URL
- Performance: Synchronous HTTP calls in request handlers

=== IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED ===

1. Fix missing imports in models/flight.py
2. Complete incomplete function implementations
3. Add proper input validation
4. Implement proper error handling patterns
5. Add CSRF protection
6. Review and test data migration logic

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===

**Short Term (Critical):**
- Fix import errors immediately
- Complete broken functions
- Add input validation to all forms
- Implement proper error boundaries

**Medium Term (Important):**
- Refactor data migration logic
- Add comprehensive logging
- Implement caching layer for JSON operations
- Add automated testing

**Long Term (Architectural):**
- Consider database migration for better performance
- Implement proper CI/CD pipeline
- Add monitoring and alerting
- Security audit and penetration testing

=== CRITICAL ERROR FOUND ===
ERROR: TypeError in features/signup/routes.py line 187
Issue: pilot["user_id"] == user_id - TypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'str'
Cause: Data format mismatch - pilots list contains strings instead of dicts
Impact: Site crashes when checking flight membership
Status: LIVE PRODUCTION BUG causing 500 errors

=== ADDITIONAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED ===

5. **MISSING CONFIG.PY** ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
   - app.py references 'config' module but config.py file missing
   - Using secret_config.py directly instead
   - No environment-specific configuration

6. **TEMPLATE SECURITY ISSUES** ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - Using Bootstrap 4.6.0 (outdated, potential vulnerabilities)
   - Font Awesome 5.15.4 loaded from CDN without integrity hashes
   - No Content Security Policy headers

7. **MISSING TACAN CHANNELS CONFIG** ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY
   - Warning in logs: "Resource file tacan_channels.json not found"
   - System creating empty resource fallback

=== CHANGES MADE ===

# APACHE RESTART SOLUTION FOR DEV/PROD ENVIRONMENT
# ================================================

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
- Beta and production share same Apache instance
- `systemctl restart apache2` affects BOTH environments
- Production users may be disrupted during beta development

## SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ RECOMMENDED: Touch WSGI file (beta app only)
```bash
touch /var/www/beta.ajac.no/wsgi.py
```
- Only restarts beta application
- Zero impact on production
- Fastest reload method

### ✅ ALTERNATIVE: Graceful Apache reload
```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```
- Reloads configs without dropping connections
- Minimal production impact
- Use for Apache config changes

### ❌ AVOID: Full Apache restart
```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2  # DON'T USE IN DEV
```
- Affects production users
- Drops all active connections
- Only use for major issues

## CHANGE LOGGING SYSTEM
- Created: COPILOT_CHANGELOG.md
- Format: Timestamp + change type + file + detailed description
- Purpose: Track all modifications with full context
- Location: /var/www/beta.ajac.no/COPILOT_CHANGELOG.md
